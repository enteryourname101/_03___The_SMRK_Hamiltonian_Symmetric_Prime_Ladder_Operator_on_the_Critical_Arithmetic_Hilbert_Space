# The SMRK Hamiltonian  
### A Symmetric Prime–Ladder Operator on the Critical Arithmetic Hilbert Space

## Overview

This document introduces the **SMRK Hamiltonian**, a concrete self-adjoint (or self-adjointly
realizable) operator encoding **prime-driven arithmetic dynamics**.

It is constructed directly on the critical arithmetic Hilbert space  
ℓ²(N, 1/n), where multiplication and division by primes become canonically adjoint.

---

## Motivation

The Hilbert–Pólya philosophy suggests that arithmetic objects (such as zeta zeros)
should arise as spectral data of a self-adjoint operator.

This work:
- does **not** claim a proof of RH
- does **not** identify zeros directly
- **does** construct a canonical arithmetic Hamiltonian suitable for spectral analysis

---

## Core Construction

The SMRK Hamiltonian combines:
- a renormalized prime kinetic term (prime ladder operators)
- a diagonal arithmetic potential (log n, von Mangoldt weights)

The operator is:
- symmetric on a natural dense core
- self-adjointly realizable
- structurally minimal and arithmetic-first

---

## What This Paper Establishes

- Canonical adjointness of prime shifts
- Existence of a critical arithmetic Hilbert space
- Renormalized self-adjoint kinetic operator
- Well-defined arithmetic Hamiltonian

---

## What This Paper Does NOT Claim

- Identification of the spectrum with zeta zeros
- Completeness of spectral correspondence
- Resolution of RH

All conjectural statements are clearly labeled.

---

## Status

**Rigorous operator construction + conjectural outlook.**

  - SMRK Trace Conjecture
  - Spectral probes and numerical experiments
- Relies on QFM concepts implicitly
